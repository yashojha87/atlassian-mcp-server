# Atlassian Jira Data Center MCP

This package provides a Machine Comprehension Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Atlassian Jira Data Center edition.

## Claude Desktop Configuration

To use this MCP connector with Claude Desktop, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

macOS:
```
~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

Windows:
```
%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atlassian-jira-dc": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@atlassian-mcp-server/jira"],
      "env": {
        "JIRA_HOST": "your-jira-host",
        "JIRA_API_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Set `JIRA_HOST` variable only to domain + port without a protocol (e.g., `your-instance.atlassian.net`). The https protocol is assumed.

Alternatively, you can use `JIRA_API_BASE_PATH` instead of `JIRA_HOST` to specify the complete API base URL including protocol (e.g., `https://your-instance.atlassian.net/rest`). Note that the `/api/2/search/` part is static and added automatically in the code, so you don't need to include it in the `JIRA_API_BASE_PATH` value.

## Features

- Search for issues using JQL (Jira Query Language)
- Get issue details by key
- Get issue comments
- Create and update issues
- Add comments to issues

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the packages/jira directory with the following variables:
   ```
   JIRA_HOST=your-jira-instance.atlassian.net
   # OR alternatively use
   # JIRA_API_BASE_PATH=https://your-jira-instance.atlassian.net/rest
   # Note: /api/latest/ is added automatically, do not include it
   JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
   ```

   To create a personal access token:
  - In Jira, select your profile picture at the top right
  - Select **Personal Access Tokens**
  - Select **Create token** and give it a name
  - Copy the token and store it securely (you won't be able to see it again)

## Usage

Start the MCP server:

```
npm run build
```

Or for development with auto-reload:

```
npm run dev
```
